# MTG_Draft_Generator
A Magit The Gathering Booster Draft generator using the https://draftpod.org draft generator.
Once you and your friends finish drafting, download the Decklist-Arena.txt and place it inside the folder
A pdf called "imprimir.pdf" will generate with your deck.

## Executable:
There is an executable in the ./dist folder for Windows. Just place the  'Decklist-Arena.txt' inside and double-click.
In Mac/Linux, execute from a console with Python. Make sure you have all the required packages installed(check the mtg-printable-draft.py imports).
Once the program starts, it will ask for the folder where 'Decklist-Arena.txt' is located.

Enjoy!
