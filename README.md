# MTG_Draft_Generator
A Magit The Gathering Booster Draft generator using the https://draftpod.org/draft/cgvYdKCo7w1iw4FKvZohNT draft generator.
Once you and your friends finish drafting, download the Decklist-Arena.txt and place it inside the folder (this build does not work between units, working on a fix).
A pdf called "imprimir.pdf" will generate with your deck.

Enjoy!
